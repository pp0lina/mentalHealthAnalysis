# Mental health in technology-related jobs: data analysis project

This project focuses on the analysis of mental health in technology-related jobs. 
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on various factors affecting mental health in individuals working in the tech industry. 

### Code components:

1.  **Preprocessing**:

    -   Data cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates)
    -   Encoding categorical variables
    -   Scaling and normalizing data for further analysis
    
2.  **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**:

    -   Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset
    
3.  **Clustering (K-Means)**:

    -   Applied K-Means clustering to group similar data points based on mental health indicators
    -   Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and the Silhouette Score
  
4.  **Data Visualization**:

    -   Used **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and other libraries to create descriptive plots for data exploration:
        -   Created pair plots and radar charts
        -   Generated a box plot of the key variable
        -   2D and 3D cluster visualization
